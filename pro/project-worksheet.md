- display a list of beers and the complete information of each one of them that will allow the customer to buy the one that best suits their needs according to its manufacture 
- Build a form to contact page
- Navbar with options that link to their corresponding pages
- Will be designed for use on all views


#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add  firebase for storage
- add function to login page and store all user post
